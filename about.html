    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Hi, I'm Ben!</h2>
    <p>I'm a User Experience Research/Designer who is passionate about making technology more accessible and easier to use, for the widest range of users, and using technology to connect people with other people.
    I'm a first year Master's degree student in UX Research and Design at the University of Michigan's School of Information. I earned a B.A. in Psychology and a Minor in Entrepreneurship from the University of Michigan. User-centered product design connects my curiosity about human behavior, my interest in improving well-being, and my passion for innovating new technologies and products.
    </p>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>I work at U of M's Information and Technology Services (ITS) , where I am the initial point of assistance for members of the university community - young and old, technically savvy and inexperienced, open to learning and intimidated by technology, native and non-native English speakers, neurotypical and neurodiverse - who need help with all manner of technology challenges. The range of challenges is huge, giving me a unique view of user experience which motivates me every day to want to make technology easier and more accessible to individuals. To illustrate, being able to help the 83 year old emeritus professor who called in, tearful and frustrated by his inability to "figure out the problem" when his email stopped working, cutting off his primary mode of communication with family during the pandemic, drives me to want to be a UX Designer!</p>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>Outside of work I love being active- tennis, exercising, and hiking (Sedona is a favorite), spending time with friends, and playing (though not as well as I used to) a little violin! Always a fan of others' design work, I've carried over a meditative-like pastime from childhood - building complex Lego structures.
    I love design and product innovation. If you want to learn more, please contact me.</p>
