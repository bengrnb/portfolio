            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For the University of Michigan's School of Information (UMSI) Introduction to Interaction Design course's individual semester-long project, I tackled the problem of how stressful, time-consuming, and frustrating it can be for U of M students to find individual and group study spaces on campus - spaces that meet their needs for an optimal study environment, along with being close by, and that can be scheduled quickly and efficiently. Background and user research demonstrated that students are feeling the stress of this challenge even more during this COVID-19 pandemic, because they have to consider social distancing needs (which has reduced the availability of spaces), as well as often have to leave one in person class and then right after find another spot to participate in a virtual class, and vice versa. The need for a solution to this problem is further supported by research which suggests that students' productivity, anxiety and stress are greatly influenced by the study space they use, which is even more true of students with disabilities based on neurodiversity and mental health (e.g., anxiety, ADHD, autism)  (Beynon-Mackinnon, et al., 2017; Weintraub, 2021).</li>
                <li>I designed a tool, a new standalone website, which will help college students at U of M locate and possibly reserve study spaces which are nearby and match their needs for certain features and resources, making for a more optimal study space for them. The tool - currently a high-fidelity prototype- is designed to provide equal access to information about space options to all U of M students, as it can be viewed accessibly from any device which has internet access, and used on-the-go, a crucial feature for busy college students! I served as UX Researcher and Designer, and product developer on this solo project. </li>
