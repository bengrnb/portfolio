            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For the University of Michigan's School of Information (UMSI) <i>Introduction to Interaction Design</i> course's individual semester-long project, I tackled the problem of how stressful, time-consuming, and frustrating it can be for U of M students to find individual and group study spaces on campus - spaces that meet their needs for an optimal study environment, along with being close by, and that can be scheduled quickly and efficiently. Background and user research demonstrated that students are feeling the stress of this challenge even more during this COVID-19 pandemic, because they have to consider social distancing needs (which has reduced the availability of spaces), as well as often have to leave one in person class and then right after find another spot to participate in a virtual class, and vice versa. The need for a solution to this problem is further supported by research which suggests that students' productivity, anxiety and stress are greatly influenced by the study space they use, which is even more true of students with disabilities based on neurodiversity and mental health (e.g., anxiety, ADHD, autism)  (Beynon-Mackinnon, et al., 2017; Weintraub, 2021).</li>
                <li>I designed a tool, a new standalone website, which will help college students at U of M locate and possibly reserve study spaces which are nearby and match their needs for certain features and resources, making for a more optimal study space for them. The tool - currently a high-fidelity prototype- is designed to provide equal access to information about space options to all U of M students, as it can be viewed accessibly from any device which has internet access, and used on-the-go, a crucial feature for busy college students! I served as UX Researcher and Designer, and product developer on this solo project.</li>

            <h2>Project Execution</h2>
            <h3>Conducted Qualitative Research | Interviewed 5 target users, undergraduate/graduate students at the University of Michigan | Prompts included</h3>
            <ul class="project-list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>When looking for a study space, what are the biggest challenges you face?</li>
                <li>When do you look for study spaces the most often (e.g., in-between classes, before classes)?</li>
                <li>What makes a study space a “best-for-you” space?</li>
                <li>What is your favorite place to study on campus? Why?</li>
                <li>What is your least favorite place to study on campus, but where you still study sometimes? Why is it your least favorite?  Why do you end up there? </li>
                <li>Lead me through the process you go through when you try to find a place to study or work? How does the process feel?</li>
                <li>How does a “bad”/”good” study space impact you (e.g., concentration, mood, productivity)?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Findings from User Interviews</h3>
            <ul class="project-list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>There are a lot of study spaces on campus, but no central service to sort through and view all of the study spaces.</li>
                <li>It's difficult to discover new spaces.</li>
                <li>Many students prefer to find study spaces that are close to them.</li>
                <li>Many students need to find study spaces quickly (e.g., in between classes).</li>
                <li>There is very little information provided about study spaces, and students have specific preferences for what constitutes a “good” space for them.</li>
                <li>Students have different needs for study spaces, depending on their task (e.g., writing a paper vs group project).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>In order to optimize the development of the U of M Spaces tool, I looked at what my main competitor - Study Space at U-M, as well as 4 other university based space search tools/systems were offering, to see what I could learn from their strengths and weaknesses.  Here are some takeaways: </p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>The tools all offered a way to locate spaces (some with very limited options), with some ability to reserve spaces.</li>
                <li>Tools' reservation functions were confusing to use and often produced misleading results.</li>
                <li>Some tools included very limited descriptions of amenities in the rooms (e.g., printers); a few offered the option to filter spaces based on limited amenity offerings.</li>
                <li>A few tools included pictures of spaces.</li>
                <li>No tool offered students the ability to upload their own pictures of spaces, to review the spaces, or to suggest new spaces.</li>
                <li>No tool had all of the elements student users reported that they needed/wanted.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Features of the U of M Spaces Website/Webapp</h3>
            <p>Combining the results of the background and user research and the competitive analysis, I identified key elements which I deemed the most important to address the problem, borrowing some elements from other sites.  I included these key elements in the creation of a low, and then medium fidelity prototype, using Figma.</p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>Search for a study space, using the tool's richly detailed information about space features (includes filters for amenities, reservation options, specific building, and more)</li>
                <li>Today's recommendations (random recommendations to help users discover new spaces)</li>
                <li>Favorite spaces and reservations (the spaces users would like to come back to, and past/current reservations)</li>
                <li>Review a study space, add a picture, or description; <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">(user examplar screens included below)</span></li>
                <li>Submit a request to add a new space to the system</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="spaces-images" style="padding: 0px; padding-top: 1em;">
                <!-- <img src="./images/spaces_images/spaces_homepage.svg" alt="U of M Spaces Homepage"> -->

                <!-- <img src="./images/spaces_images/spaces_leave_reviewe.svg" alt="U of M Spaces Leave Review"> -->
            </div>
            <h3>Conducted Usability Testing</h3>
            <p>Conducted usability testing on the medium fidelity prototype, and iterated the design to reflect user feedback.</p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>Overall, users found the tool to be “intuitive” in design - reporting that it was easy to navigate and that “tasks” (e.g., filtering for amenities) could be completed quickly. Several users commented on the enjoyable aesthetics of the tool.</li>
                <li>Where users reported confusion about aspects of the design, or steps in a process, I reworked the tool using this feedback (e.g., Users had difficulty locating the button to view past reservations; I reworked the design to make the button to “view past reservations” easier to find and to clarify the function of the button).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Created High Fidelity Prototype (in Figma)</h3>
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/T34gIo1Nh9sVwUHmPYQjNm/Digital-Prototype-II?node-id=110%3A813&page-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=110%3A813&viewport=241%2C48%2C1.34" target="_blank"><u>View High Fidelity Prototype &#11016;</u></a>
            <h2>Potential Outcome and Social Impacts of U of M Spaces Tool</h2>
            <p>If implemented, the tool will help students at U of M easily and efficiently locate and possibly reserve study spaces which are nearby and match their needs for certain features and resources, securing a more optimal study space for them. The tool will have a positive social impact on the U of M campus in 3 ways:</p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>It <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">will promote social engagement</span> with the campus community by encouraging students to contribute to the growth of the site to help one another have a better experience finding best-for-them study spaces.</li>
                <li>As the tool reduces frustration and stress for already stressed students when they are looking for spaces, and helps people do their best academically by helping them identify optimal study spaces, the tool <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">will promote mental health and academic success.</span></li>
                <li>The tool <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">will promote equity and support students' diverse needs;</span> the tool makes it easy for all students to access the  same information, quickly and easily. In addition, I hope that having access to rich information will be of special help to students with disabilities who may need extra help identifying spaces that are a good fit for their needs.</li>
