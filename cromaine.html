            <h2>Project Overview (NOT CORRECT)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The client. a public library in a smaller semi-rural community in Michigan, which serves as the information and cultural hub of its geographic area, sought a user needs evaluation and a user experience design consultation to be able to provide the best web-based experience for the community. The current site struggled with accessibility, technical problems loading on some devices, jargony language which often frustrated patrons, and a confusing, overstimulating layout which stymied patrons in their search for information. Given the central role this public library plays in connecting citizens to information and to each other via community events and activities, it was hoped that a major-overhaul of the website would better serve all sectors of the community, from childern/teens to young adults, to the elderly.</li>
                <li>The client partnered with the Univeristy of Michigan's School of Information (UMSI) Design Clinic, a competitive, designer application-only experience, which provides interdisciplinary teams of 4 to 6 students to opportunity to work with clients "to seek innovative solutions to information challenges." I worked as a Needs and Usability Researcher, and UX Researcher and Designer on the project.</li>
                <li>Our team redesigned the website to address specific tasks patrons are trying to accomplish, while also supporting the library's function as a key information and cultural resource. In addition, our team will prepare a proposed interface for the new site, document the elements which should be on the home and secondary pages, and make recommendations for plainer vocabulary which will be less frustrating for patrons, and so, facilitate their task completion.</li>

            <p>Analyzed the current site | Google Analytics</p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>Devices used to access the website: While the majority (62.4%) of library patrons accessed the website using a desktop device, more than a third (35.7%) relied on their mobile device, with the remaining patrons using a tablet (1.9%), highlighting the need to redesign the website with attention to both desktop and mobile applications.</li>
                <li>User age demographics: The library website was found to be visited by a wide age-range of patrons, from age 18 to 65+, in equal measure, with the exception of patrons ages 35-44 years, who were the most frequent users. Design challenges needed, then, to be equally accessible and useable by this full developmental range.</li>

            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>What type of device do you typically access the library website on?: 45% mobile, 19% two or more devices; 32% desktop/laptop; 3% tablet; again, use this deata to reinforce importance of attention to mobile design, which had not been a design priority for existing website.</li>
                <li>How frequently do you use the Cromaine District library website? Data indicated high use, underscoring its important role in the community as an infomraitonal hib, with about 5% of users visiting daily, almost 30% 3-4 times/week, and approximately 45% 3-4 times/month.</li>
                <li>What do you use the library website for the most?</li>

            <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
            <p>In order to optimize the development of the U of M Spaces tool, I looked at what my main competitor - Study Space at U-M, as well as 4 other university based space search tools/systems were offering, to see what I could learn from their strengths and weaknesses.  Here are some takeaways: </p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>The tools all offered a way to locate spaces (some with very limited options), with some ability to reserve spaces.</li>
                <li>Tools' reservation functions were confusing to use and often produced misleading results.</li>
                <li>Some tools included very limited descriptions of amenities in the rooms (e.g., printers); a few offered the option to filter spaces based on limited amenity offerings.</li>
                <li>A few tools included pictures of spaces.</li>
                <li>No tool offered students the ability to upload their own pictures of spaces, to review the spaces, or to suggest new spaces.</li>
                <li>No tool had all of the elements student users reported that they needed/wanted.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Key Features of the U of M Spaces Website/Webapp</h4>
            <p>Combining the results of the background and user research and the competitive analysis, I identified key elements which I deemed the most important to address the problem, borrowing some elements from other sites.  I included these key elements in the creation of a low, and then medium fidelity prototype, using Figma.</p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>Search for a study space, using the tool's richly detailed information about space features (includes filters for amenities, reservation options, specific building, and more)</li>
                <li>Today's recommendations (random recommendations to help users discover new spaces)</li>
                <li>Favorite spaces and reservations (the spaces users would like to come back to, and past/current reservations)</li>
                <li>Review a study space, add a picture, or description; <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">(user examplar screens included below)</span></li>
                <li>Submit a request to add a new space to the system</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="spaces-images" style="padding: 0px; padding-top: 1em;">
                <!-- <img src="./images/spaces_images/spaces_homepage.svg" alt="U of M Spaces Homepage"> -->

                <!-- <img src="./images/spaces_images/spaces_leave_reviewe.svg" alt="U of M Spaces Leave Review"> -->
            </div>
            <h4>Conducted Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>Conducted usability testing on the medium fidelity prototype, and iterated the design to reflect user feedback.</p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>Overall, users found the tool to be “intuitive” in design - reporting that it was easy to navigate and that “tasks” (e.g., filtering for amenities) could be completed quickly. Several users commented on the enjoyable aesthetics of the tool.</li>
                <li>Where users reported confusion about aspects of the design, or steps in a process, I reworked the tool using this feedback (e.g., Users had difficulty locating the button to view past reservations; I reworked the design to make the button to “view past reservations” easier to find and to clarify the function of the button).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Created High Fidelity Prototype (in Figma)</h4>
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/T34gIo1Nh9sVwUHmPYQjNm/Digital-Prototype-II?node-id=110%3A813&page-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=110%3A813&viewport=241%2C48%2C1.34" target="_blank"><u>View High Fidelity Prototype &#11016;</u></a>
            <h2>Potential Outcome and Social Impacts of U of M Spaces Tool</h2>
            <p>If implemented, the tool will help students at U of M easily and efficiently locate and possibly reserve study spaces which are nearby and match their needs for certain features and resources, securing a more optimal study space for them. The tool will have a positive social impact on the U of M campus in 3 ways:</p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>It <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">will promote social engagement</span> with the campus community by encouraging students to contribute to the growth of the site to help one another have a better experience finding best-for-them study spaces.</li>
                <li>As the tool reduces frustration and stress for already stressed students when they are looking for spaces, and helps people do their best academically by helping them identify optimal study spaces, the tool <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">will promote mental health and academic success.</span></li>
                <li>The tool <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">will promote equity and support students' diverse needs;</span> the tool makes it easy for all students to access the  same information, quickly and easily. In addition, I hope that having access to rich information will be of special help to students with disabilities who may need extra help identifying spaces that are a good fit for their needs.</li>
