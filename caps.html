            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>CAPS nurtures the psychological development and emotional well-being of students through counseling, therapy, preventative and educational programming, outreach and consultation. The CAPS website redesign was initiated at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the challenge to transition what are traditionally face-to-face services to an online format was met with a marked increase in need for psychological support services; students faced academic disruption, social isolation, dislocation, loss, and fear about health and the future.</li>
                <li>For our ITS Summer 2020 Internship cohort project (all virtual), our 5 person team independently conceived of, pitched, and executed the website redesign with the goal of making it easier, quicker and less stressful for our already highly distressed peers to identify what services CAPS could offer and to navigate access to those resources; we realized we all had experience with peers sharing frustration about securing mental health services when needed. In addition, we noticed a number of issues and points of confusion with the existing CAPS website. CAPS encouraged and supported our efforts. Our team was the only Intern cohort to tackle a project outside of ITS.</li>
                <li>To improve the potential of the website to serve the needs and enhance the emotional well being of students, we recreated the website from the ground up (e.g., consolidating redundant information, assessing which pages were visited most and then making it easier to get to those pages, and making sure students could access emergency services no matter which page they were on). We focused on feedback which was deemed the most important by user research conducted with students, and by members of the CAPS staff whom we interviewed. My primary roles in the project included being the Project Manager (using Agile development practices) and UX Researcher/Designer.</li>

            </ul>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;color: #BFB78F;">CAPS Website Homepage: Pre and Post Redesign</h4>
            <div class="caps-images">
                <img src="./images/caps_images/caps_before.png" alt="CAPS Website Before">
                <img src="./images/caps_images/caps_after.png" alt="CAPS Website After">
            </div>
            <p>This pre-post website redesign of the CAPS Homepage illustrates <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">one of the primary design goals</span> of our project: <span style="color: #BFB78F; font-weight: bold;">to help stressed, distressed, and overwhelmed students access mental health services more quickly and easily.</span> We placed the “Make an Appointment” and “Urgent Support” buttons on the top of every page, each with a more prominent, distinct shape, which the user's eye is immediately drawn to, without interference from any other elements on the Home and Secondary pages.</p>
            <h2>Project Execution</h2>
            <p>Steps along the way as part of the design and development process included:</p>
            <h3>Stakeholder/Client Consultation</h3>
            <p>Consulted with CAPS staff to understand why current website decisions were made, and to focus the project scope given the tight time constraints of the internship.</p>
            <h3>User Research on Existing Website (Pre-test)</h3>
            <ul class="project-list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>Conducted qualitative and quantitative user research , with 16 user subjects, all undergraduates at the University of Michigan, including:</li>
                <ul class="project-list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Live interviewing of user subjects while they performed tasks we presented to them (e.g., “ Walk us through scheduling a psychotherapy appointment”; “Show us how you would access emergency mental health services,” and “How easy/stressful was that task for you?” etc.), so we could identify pain points in the process.</li>
                    <li>Free response questions to understand better user needs for the website (e.g., “During this time of uncertainty, what services/resources would you like to see on the website that you do not see now?”).</li>
                    <li>Service Discoverability user testing, during which we sought to understand how easily students could identify available services from the Home Page, as well as identify which services offered (and desired) are not even presented to student users on the Home Page.</li>
                    <li>Identified (through observations of user subjects, along with our own in-depth exploration of the website) problems with site pages (e.g., broken links, incorrect information - different hours of operation listed on different pages, unhelpful information redundancy).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Analyzed user-testing data and information from CAPS stakeholders interviews.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key User Research Findings on Existing Website</h3>
            <ul class="project-list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>Most students felt that the Homepage was too busy, with the layout obscuring the most crucial services/information, frustrating users' task completion.</li>
                <li>Many students felt it was difficult/frustrating to schedule emergency services and initial consultations.</li>
                <li>Many students felt that the dropdown menus were confusing/“not intuitive” (e.g. confusing terminology -“What is Crisis Services?”).</li>
                <li>Most Students had difficulty locating the FAQ page.</li>
                <li>The website has outdated/broken/archived/too many links.</li>
                <li>We noted several other areas that may be compromising user experience, including: the site is more information than goal based (e.g., read about a wellness seminar versus how to talk to someone); there is redundant information across pages, but the information may be slightly different from page to page (e.g., the hours of operation varied);  there are a lot of drop down menus, making it difficult for users to easily identify sought-after information; the FAQ page is challenging to navigate and is missing important questions relevant to why people visit the site.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Design Goals</h3>
            <ul class="project-list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>Simplify the Homepage layout, to help students quickly and easily identify crucial information and services.</li>
                <li>Make it possible and easy for students to schedule emergency and initial consultation services from every page (making the site more goal, not information based).</li>
                <li>Reorganize and consolidate information on the dropdown menus (i.e., reducing overall number of dropdown menus).</li>
                <li>Reorganize and simplify information on Secondary pages, to reduce redundancy and competing information.</li>
                <li>Make FAQ page easier to access, and inclusive of more goal-focused questions.</li>
                <li>Fix broken/outdated links (shared information with CAPS; fixes did not make it into our redesign).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Designed and iterated increasingly high-fidelity mock-ups, using Adobe XD, to create a high-fidelity prototype of the CAPS website redesign</h3>

            <p>Conducted qualitative and quantitative user research , with 16 user subjects, all undergraduates at the University of Michigan, including:</p>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>Repeated pre-test protocol on same subjects (see above), using a pre-and-post test research design.</li>
                <li>Analyzed user-testing data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key User Research Findings on Redesigned Website</h3>
            <ul class="project-list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>The website redesign prototype was a resounding success, as evidenced by our pre-and-post user testing findings!</li>
                <li>User students found our prototype faster and easier (i.e., less stressful) to use, than the original website.</li>

            <h3>Final presentation to Stakeholders, including both CAPS and ITS staff</h3>
            <h2>Outcomes & Next Steps</h2>
            <ul class="project-list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>CAPS' staff reported that they will be updating their existing website with a few of the elements we included in the redesign, as an initial step.  They thanked us for starting an important conversation, and will look to including more of the elements of our redesign when CAPS undergoes a planned, large-scale renovation.</li>
                <li>In the meanwhile, CAPS requested that UM ITS create a dedicated intern team for the next summer's intern cohort, to continue working on the project, which was the first such request from an organization outside of ITS.</li>
                <li>Our goal of helping our peers to have easier access to and increased awareness of the mental health services offered through CAPS, especially during this time of unprecedented need for services, will have been advanced as CAPS incorporates some of our design elements into its website. The project, undertaken by 5 interns with no prior UX Research and Design skills or background, taught us about the importance of good design, challenged us to tackle a steep learning curve with tight time constraints, and inspired this would-be UX Researcher/Designer to pursue graduate work in the field!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Thank you to UM ITS and UM CAPS for supporting our project!</h4>
